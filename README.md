# Watermarking-Images-using-General-NMF-
I have tried to implement this project based on the following paper. 

* Z. Chen, L. Li, H. Peng, Y. Liu, and Y. Yang, “A novel digital watermarking based on general non-negative matrix factorization,” IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 20, no. 8, pp. 1973–1986, Aug 2018

You can run the project by running the main.m file.
